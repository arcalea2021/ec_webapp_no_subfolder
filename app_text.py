Simply stated, the total number of organic keywords a brand has corresponds to the <b>number of opportunities</b> to rank. Thus, when strategic content production is paired with the Search Ranking Factors recommendations, such as authoritative link building, the brand is able to graduate the domain’s known keywords from positions 11-100 to 4-10, and subsequently from 4-10 to 1-3. This two-fold approach increases both the <b>number of ranking opportunities</b>, as well as the <b>potential for page one placement per opportunity</b>, ultimately allowing brands to command greater click-through-rate (CTR) on search result pages for given queries and increase organic visibility.</p>'
